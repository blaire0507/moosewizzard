  Classic is better than retail because is is more rewarding and social. Classic is more difficult, which allows for a higher reward. Classic also pushes for social interaction because of the difficulty and nothing is layed out to the user like it is in retail. There are no short-cuts in Classic where retail has made short cuts availible to users for ease and simplicity reasonings. However, these have also decreased the social aspect becasue there is no longer reason for teamwork and information is readibly availible where in Classic information is spread by trial and error, or by open dialogue between users rather than user with the internet or another uninteractive source.
